# 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m a backend developer working (non-paid) on a game server network.  
I love building things that just work, and I’m currently super proud of an upcoming project (can’t share details yet, but stay tuned!).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** React (some experience)
- **Languages:** TypeScript (main focus)

## 🌱 Interests
- Low-level security (always wanted to dive deeper, but TypeScript keeps me busy!)
- Currently watching Outer banks on Netflix

## ⚡ Philosophy
> If it works, it works.
